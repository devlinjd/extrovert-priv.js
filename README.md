# Extrovert.js #

3Dify your websites, blogs, RSS feeds, and image galleries.

>Because websites, blogs, RSS feed, and image galleries be all like, yo, where my 3D at?

Extrovert.js is a JavaScript library that supports on-the-fly generation of 3D geometry from HTML pages or other arbitrary markup (RSS, JSON, etc.).

## Usage ##

1. Download the Extrovert sources manually or via Bower:

        bower install extrovert

2. Link to the sources in your HTML.

        <script src="/path/to/extrovert.min.js" type="text/javascript">

3. Initialize the Extrovert library:

        EXTROVERT.init();

## Development Roadmap ##

Extrovert.js is in active development and we'd like to groom it to be your go-to choice for irreverent, silly, often pointless 3D visualizations of arbitrary website data. That said, here's what's on the immediate agenda:

- Remove jQuery dependency.
- Better IE and Safari support.
- More generators!
- More rasterizers!
- Implement [bin packing](http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/5/7/bin_packing/).
- HTML-to-SVG texture rasterization.
- Additional physics libraries.
- Support plugin versions of the library.
- Remove Three.js dependency.
- Additional samples and docs.
